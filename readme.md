## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA! Office hours are on Discord and Zoom. If none of the times for for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.

## Version control! :tada:

If you didn't make a GitHub account already, do that super quick right now _because_:

This week we will be applying some of our command-line knowledge to learn how to use `git`! The format for today is the same as last week: follow along with me in your lecture notebook. Then, at the end, I'll explain your group project assignment!

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab to
3. Type in git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-5.git and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-5)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the Friday after your next lab session. You'll be submitting your GitHub repo!

To submit: copy the URL of your repo and submit it to Canvas. Each group member needs to do this.
